00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
我猜你沒有預料到。
I guess you weren't expecting it.

00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
到底是怎麼回事？
What the hell is going on?

00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
我們現在已經到達跳船了。
We have now reached the jump ship.

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
嗯，估計手術不太順利。
Well, I guess the surgery didn't go so well.

00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
你已經去世了，拉里。
You've passed away, Larry.

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
你好。
Hello.

00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
我是安娜。我是你來世的四分之一黑格爾。
I'm Anna. I'm your afterlife quarter-neiger.

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
那不是一份工作。
That's not a job.

00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
這就是交界處，你選擇一個地方度過永恆。
And this is the junction, where you choose one place to spend eternity.

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
你想吸鼻子嗎？
Do you want a little sniffle?

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
和誰一起度過？
And who to spend it with?

00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
約翰！約翰！
John! John!

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
我在那隻眼睛裡很糟糕。
I was in bad in that eye.

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
你看起來很瘋狂。
You look crazy.

00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
我這是一個令人震驚的消息。
I'm shocking news.

00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
你死定了。
You're dead.

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
是啊，你怎麼知道？
Yeah, how'd you know?

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
他花了很長時間才弄清楚這一點。
It took him forever to figure that out.

00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
打擾一下。
Excuse me.

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
為了這個金鬼，我已經等了67年神債了。
I've been waiting for this Golden Ghost for 67 God-debt years.

00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
我去過。
I've been.

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
強烈建議使用很多管子來吸進和呼出茶。
A lot of tubes are highly recommended just taking tea breath in and out.

00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
只是呼吸。
Just breathe.

00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
我從來沒有清楚地夢見過耶穌。
I never dreamt Jesus clearly.

00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
正是我夢見你的樣子。
Exactly how I dreamt you.

00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
哦，不。
Oh, no.

00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
這傢伙怎麼樣？
How's this guy?

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
第一任丈夫。
First husband.

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
他死於一場戰爭。
He died in a war.

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
你不擔心嗎？
Don't you worry?

00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
蜂蜜。
Honey.

00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
我知道這很多，但別擔心。
I know this is a lot, but don't worry.

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
我一直在做研究。
I've been doing the research.

00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
拉里！
Larry!

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
拉里什麼意思？
What do you mean Larry?

00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
一周前我們在一起了。
We're together a week ago.

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
那麼，一周內發生了什麼？
Well, what has happened in a week?

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
你死了。
You died.

00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
我死了。
I died.

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
我剛剛與我死去的兩個丈夫團聚。
I just been reunited with both of my dead husbands.

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
我來選擇在哪裡度過永恆。
And I come to pick where to spend eternity.

00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
我來這裡是為了死。
I'm here to die.

00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
你做到了。
You made it.

00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
67年。
67 years.

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
當永恆都對齊時，似乎什麼都不是。
When eternity's all aligned, seems like nothing.

00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
這是一個很好的開場。
It's a good opening.

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
你是個潛伏者，朋友。
You're a lurker, pal.

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
你正在等待破壞半個世紀的婚姻。
You're waiting beyond to spoil a half a century of marriage.

00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
這不是一場比賽。
It's not a competition.

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
是的。
Yes, it is.

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
親愛的，這是100%確定的嗎？
Sweetheart, is it 100% for sure?

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
這是。
It is.

00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
但這不是一場比賽。
But it's not a competition.

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
這正是我們來這裡的目的。
That's literally what we're here for.

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
我希望你有自己的生活。
I wanted you to have a life.

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
但我希望我們也有機會擁有這樣的機會。
But I wanted us to have a chance to have one, too.

00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
他們太浪漫了。
They're so romantic.

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
我可以很浪漫。

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
好吧，我們到這裡就結束了。
Okay, we're here to end up.

00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
只要我們在一起。
Just as long as we're together.

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
你必須提醒她看電影愛你。
You're going to have to remind her of watching film loves you.

00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
沒有一個人讓你快樂讓我快樂。
No one you're happy makes me happy.

00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
永恆是一段很長的時間，有遺憾。
Eternity is a long time to have regrets.

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
所以...
So...

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
你選擇了你的永恆嗎？
